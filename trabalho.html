     <h4>In this pandemic, we had several problems, including financial, health and work problems, in addition to the social side.<br>
<br>But we had a lot of help from our technology, especially the internet, which is so vast and can be used very well.<br><br>
Through it many people held meetings for jobs (which was essential for many people), religious services and even worked through it and did school lessons.<br><br>
